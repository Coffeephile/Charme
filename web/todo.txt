QUEUE BASED SERVER 2 SERVER COMMUNICATION

request sending with priorities
0: instant () comment delete, post delete
3: (max 30 seconds) , posts, messages, new comment
6: max 2 minutes: friendreuqests, subscribe requests
6: (max 10 minutes)
9: (max 1h)
12: (max 1d)




-get name for new posts in getPofile.php

-name in profile in fixed div to prevent recurrent database access

+ check if collection follow is allowed
+ Maximal Post lenght!



DEV NOTES
----------------------------------
- nanoScroller needs a .content element inside .nano
- user iterator_to_array for json encoded remote requests
- use single quotes to access dollar indices in arrays like $item["_id"]['$id']
