TODO:

* **Sign Lists:** Currently the server can return additional People for a list. So the server can return some person he knows the private key and read the message posted in an encrypted collection

* Edgekeys: Prevent sending old key revisions! Check key Revisions beforehand! Delete old public keys from localkeydir!
* Recrypt edgekey: can server return additional posts?
* Server can return wrong public keys or userIds/usernames when starting new conversations: Solution: encrypt username/userid with fastkey1 and check for userId == decryptedPubKey.userId

* how to check that messagekey is the newest one?

* encrypt username and userid of users in keydir with fastkey1
