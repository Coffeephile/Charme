# Charme


Charme is a distributed and open source social network. In contrast to classic social networks you can save your user data on your own server or a server of your choice. The project is splitted into the following sub projects:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Path</td>
        <td>Description</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/web</td>
        <td>Files of the old version.</td>

    </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>/android</td>
        <td>Android App Files</td>

    </tr>

     <tr>
        <td>/demo</td>
        <td>Various screenshots and promotion images.</td>

    </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>/jsclient</td>
        <td>HTML5 based client for Encrypted Communication</td>

    </tr>

     <tr>
        <td>/server</td>
        <td>Server for Encrypted Communication</td>

    </tr>
