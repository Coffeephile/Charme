# Charme Public Key Verification


## Abstract
Verifying public keys is a necessary part for each user to be safe against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. 
The verification can be done manually, but this is quite uncomfortable.
Another option is to gather public keys from people you trust.

Basically we always have 1+x keysources, where 1 is the key owners host and x are people who have verified the key.
