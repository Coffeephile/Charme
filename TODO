## current todo:
1) delete comments/posts
2) update keyhash on key directory recrypt
3) keymanager_checkRevCounter callqÃ¶
4) responsive mode
5) host public keys on server (via class App\Security\PublicKeys)


## to test (also for multiserver)
post_comment_distribute



## signatures for posts and messages
   - Save all public key revisions of other users to validate signatures
   - Repost and like verification by signing and storing hash on server
   - Important: Warn if newer public key available
   - On recrypt: Resign all posts

## ROADMAP

HIGH PRIORITY
- Perfect Forward Secrecy: Delete old private Keys from Encrypted Data Storage.
	-> Problem: How to decrypt old messages?: Solution: Recrypt! (recrypt ok (?))
- make sure sendernames/ids can not be changed in messages!
- Multiserver support
- message send: get public key,
	- autocomplete use $in to check if key available
	- add person to mesasge / leave message


------
- demo video
- key hash: do not use fastkey1 as hashvalue, use randomsalt1 instead
- messages: send: autocomplete only receivers with key
- badkey error , when new bucket, and request send. error disapears when saving private info again.
- revision counter
- Recrypt Public Key Directory when changing key
  -> note down all public key encrypted data!




MEDIUM PRIORITY
#- GCM: do not notify myself if message is from me
- images zip download: ignore failed request attempts
- testing library
- Make sure requests are delivered, repeat if failed to deliver
- notify users on pub key update: hash public key A , send to user B encrypted with pub key B 
- key directory cache
-keyupdate:
	- notify message receiver that key is no longer valid
	- recrypt with new fastkey: 
		- key directory
		- buckets
		- messages (?)
- Public key verification in background

LOW PRIORITY
- Delete Post and Comments
- love/repost on status detail not working
- revoke private info access
- notify people who are not in lists any more!
- RSA decryption in web worker
- repost images, cache image on own server then.
- small image  appended to post is scaled to big for thumbnail

## Spam Protect&Security
 - likes only from people in my lists
 - subscribers only from people in my lists?
- Check also ids for XSS attacks!
