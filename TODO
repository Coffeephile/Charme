TOP PRIORITY:
- better logout, see request.js, loggin out
- test debian setup script
- image upload in message not wokring
- key updates!

- 3. improve audience limiter for context items with signature  60 MIN BIB!!!
- lmit collection audience when displaying collection.
- complete filters!
  - comments:
    - if filter: cache stream for 3 days and register for comment updates druign that periode
    - if post is archived then do not show comments!!!
    - :
  - Cron JOB: Delete Stream items older than...
  - No Context in collections!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  ; kein filter darf nur subscribed anzeigen (und encrypted)
  / Do collection ssubscriptio nwork afterwards??
  - FILTERS CONTRAINTS:
    - load all into box_filter
      - build schema
      - iterate schema, generate input fields
    - hide/show on context change
    -\
  - Context Options: visible for all people, or lists only!

- load more messages displaying duplicates
- lists are not shown in other users profil FIXED?
- make key updates working
- reponsive search etc.
- responsive message back button not wokring
=================================================

if own key not added:
- collections do not display own posts
- no messages to myself etc.
---> SOLUTION: Add own key at the start.

responsive search etc.
   save image height

-----------------
MULTI USER Tests

- no notificatoins for own actions
- Key recrypt, public key update!!,
  - public key update notification
  -
- maintain edgekey revision correctly
-
-----------------




documentation

- multiple editors per collection
  -> STEP 1 edit field in properties
  -> step 2 inform new editors if they were elected editor
  -> step 3: author sends new posts to collection owner server who then distributes it
security:
  sign fileId

window.addEventListener("error", function(e) {
before message all keys including own key is required to add!!!!!!!!!


major bugs:
  stream updates not working
 only add postitems if all decrypted!

message refactoring:
-1: save charme version in charme cache
 0. messages to myself are created twice
 1. message owner is current sender link / image server -> must be author!
2. messages responsive
3. images (+picturebox generic)
4. cache EDGEKEYS IN STREAM key: (userid+edgekeyrevision)!!!!!!

edgekeys:
1. key exists on profile working correctly?
2. update all edgekeys when my public key changes
3. update 1 edgekey if publicKey of another users changes
4. update edgekey encrypted postkeys!
5. only update edgekey if new public key revision when clicking on profile link update
6. make sure returned edgekey revision is not an old one when encrypting with edgekey.

misc:
2. update encryptedcollectionstate after collection edit to encrypted collection
4. search responsive complete
5. delete comments     -> sign id+action    for delete command, like post!

major changes:
 ☐  do not use fastkey1 for hash values (search fastkey1!)
 ☐ keymanager_checkRevCount
       alternative: do not allow old public keys by receiver!
 ☐ recrypt: update of data needed before new recrypt!
    -> check current revision here
 ☐ (use this key to encrypt posts later)


## signatures for posts and messages
   - Save all public key revisions of other users to validate signatures
   - Repost and like verification by signing and storing hash on server
   - Important: Warn if newer public key available
   - On recrypt: Resign all posts

## ROADMAP

HIGH PRIORITY
- Delete old private Keys from Encrypted Data Storage.
- make sure sendernames/ids can not be changed in messages! -> SIGN!
- Multiserver support


------

- key hash: do not use fastkey1 as hashvalue, use randomsalt1 instead
- messages: send: autocomplete only receivers with key
- badkey error , when new bucket, and request send. error disapears when saving private info again.
- revision counter
- Recrypt Public Key Directory when changing key
  -> note down all public key encrypted data!




MEDIUM PRIORITY
#- GCM: do not notify myself if message is from me
- sign comments
- signature verification also on client side
- images zip download: ignore failed request attempts
- testing library
- Make sure requests are delivered, repeat if failed to deliver
- notify users on pub key update: hash public key A , send to user B encrypted with pub key B
- key directory cache
-keyupdate:
	- notify message receiver that key is no longer valid
	- recrypt with new fastkey:
		- key directory
		- buckets
		- messages (?)
- Public key verification in background

LOW PRIORITY
- love/repost on status detail not working
- revoke private info access
- notify people who are not in lists any more!r
- repost images, cache image on own server then.
- small image  appended to post is scaled to big for thumbnail



## Development Areas
Note: We have the Instant section for code tasks that do not require much knowledge about the whole architecture.

   - Core
   - Performance
   - Message Distribution
   - GCM

   - iOS



## Spam Protect&Security
 - likes only from people in my lists
 - subscribers only from people in my lists?
- Check also ids for XSS attacks!
