## next:


	
	conversation start: get key if not exists

	javascript image zip downloader http://stuk.github.io/jszip/

	add/remove people -> new aes key! (is this necessary? )

	problem: add my self to some strangers messages
	solution: make hash of people list and encode hash with aes key

## MILESTONE 3
	


	Comments (OK)
	Make sure requests are delivered, repeat if failed to deliver
	Multiserver support
	Message Signing, Repost and like verification
	Private Key Directory (OK)
	Delete Collections and Comments
	revision counter!

	background sender!


	notify users on pub key update:
		hash public key A , send to user B encrypted with pub key B 

## small bugs
- small image  appended to post is scaled to big for thumbnail


## TODO HIGH PRIORITY

- key hash: do not use fastkey1 as hashvalue, use randomsalt1 instead
- messages: send: only receivers with key!, warning if no key!

- badkey error , when new bucket, and request send. error disapears when saving private info again.

- revision counter
- Recrypt Public Key Directory when changing key
- message send: get public key,
	- autocomplete use $in to check if key available
	- add person to mesasge / leave message

- Public key verification in background
- avoid comments with false author


## keyupdate

- notify message receiver that key is no longer valid
- recrypt with new fastkey: 
	- key directory
	- buckets
	- messages (?)

## Spam Protect
 - likes only from people in my lists
 - subscribers only from people in my lists?

## XSS 
- Check also ids for XSS attacks!

## TODO LOW PRIORITY

- Delete Post and Comments
- love/repost on status detail not working
- revoke private info access
- notify people who are not in lists any more!
- RSA decryption in web worker
- repost images, cache image on own server then.



## Implemented but not fully tested:
- update session passphrase with newest key_getPrivateKeyring (OK1)
- remove passphrase from accessible code, use fastkey instead (OK1)
