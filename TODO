## ROADMAP

HIGH PRIORITY
- Multiserver support
- password sign in: get challenge from server!
- demo video
- Repost and like verification by signing and storing hash on server
- message send: get public key,
	- autocomplete use $in to check if key available
	- add person to mesasge / leave message

- SECURE LOGIN: send challenge to client, hash pw with challenge, send back.
------
- key hash: do not use fastkey1 as hashvalue, use randomsalt1 instead
- messages: send: autocomplete only receivers with key
- badkey error , when new bucket, and request send. error disapears when saving private info again.
- revision counter
- Recrypt Public Key Directory when changing key
- Public key verification in background
- avoid comments with false author



MEDIUM PRIORITY
- images zip download: ignore failed request attempts
- testing library
- Make sure requests are delivered, repeat if failed to deliver
- notify users on pub key update: hash public key A , send to user B encrypted with pub key B 
- key directory cache
-keyupdate:
	- notify message receiver that key is no longer valid
	- recrypt with new fastkey: 
		- key directory
		- buckets
		- messages (?)

LOW PRIORITY
- javascript image zip downloader http://stuk.github.io/jszip/
- Delete Post and Comments
- love/repost on status detail not working
- revoke private info access
- notify people who are not in lists any more!
- RSA decryption in web worker
- repost images, cache image on own server then.
- small image  appended to post is scaled to big for thumbnail



## Spam Protect&Security
 - likes only from people in my lists
 - subscribers only from people in my lists?
