## ROADMAP

HIGH PRIORITY
- GCM: do not notify myself if message is from me
- make sure sendernames/ids can not be changed in messages!
- Multiserver support
- password sign in: get challenge from server!
	1. get salt from server. make random value in collection "salts" if user not exists
	2. use salt to hash pw and send hashed pw back to server. 
	
	login: get salt from server by uid, hash it and send back to server
 - FINISH RECRYPT in key_update_recrypt_setData	
- server public key directory

  - change password, login, change passphrase!
  -
- Repost and like verification by signing and storing hash on server
- message send: get public key,
	- autocomplete use $in to check if key available
	- add person to mesasge / leave message

- SECURE LOGIN: send challenge to client, hash pw with challenge, send back.
------
- demo video
- key hash: do not use fastkey1 as hashvalue, use randomsalt1 instead
- messages: send: autocomplete only receivers with key
- badkey error , when new bucket, and request send. error disapears when saving private info again.
- revision counter
- Recrypt Public Key Directory when changing key
  -> note down all public key encrypted data!




MEDIUM PRIORITY
- images zip download: ignore failed request attempts
- testing library
- Make sure requests are delivered, repeat if failed to deliver
- notify users on pub key update: hash public key A , send to user B encrypted with pub key B 
- key directory cache
-keyupdate:
	- notify message receiver that key is no longer valid
	- recrypt with new fastkey: 
		- key directory
		- buckets
		- messages (?)
- Public key verification in background

LOW PRIORITY
- Delete Post and Comments
- love/repost on status detail not working
- revoke private info access
- notify people who are not in lists any more!
- RSA decryption in web worker
- repost images, cache image on own server then.
- small image  appended to post is scaled to big for thumbnail



## Spam Protect&Security
 - likes only from people in my lists
 - subscribers only from people in my lists?
- Check also ids for XSS attacks!
