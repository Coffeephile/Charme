## MILESTONE 3
	
	Comments (OK)
	Make sure requests are delivered, repeat if failed to deliver
	Multiserver support
	Message Signing, Repost and like verification
	Private Key Directory (OK)
	Delete Collections and Comments

## TODO HIGH PRIORITY

- key hash: do not use fastkey1 as hashvalue, use randomsalt1 instead
- messages: send: only receivers with key!, warning if no key!

- nan bug
- badkey error , when new bucket, and request send. error disapears when saving private info again.


- Recrypt Public Key Directory when changing key
- message send: get public key,
	- autocomplete use $in to check if key available
	- add perosn to mesasge / leave message

- Public key verification in background
- avoid comments with false author
- private collections: add people to collections.

## keyupdate

- notify message receiver that key is no longer valid
- recrypt with new fastkey: 

## Spam Protect
 - likes only from people in my lists
 - subscribers only from people in my lists?

## XSS 
- Check also ids for XSS attacks!

## TODO LOW PRIORITY

- Delete Post and Comments
- love/repost on status detail not working
- revoke private info access
- notify people who are not in lists any more!
- RSA decryption in web worker
- repost images, cache image on own server then.



## Implemented but not fully tested:
- update session passphrase with newest key_getPrivateKeyring (OK1)
- remove passphrase from accessible code, use fastkey instead (OK1)
